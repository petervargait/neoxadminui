## Technical Details

### GlobalState Integration
All major data is now properly connected to GlobalStateContext:
- ✅ Tenants
- ✅ Users (with profile selection)
- ✅ Tickets
- ✅ Tasks
- ✅ White Label Settings
- ✅ Audit Logs
- ⚠️ Badges (connected but needs user selection refactor)
- ⚠️ Invitations (needs connection in tenant site)
- ⚠️ Parking Spaces (needs connection in tenant site)
- ⚠️ Policies (needs visibility in tenant site)

### Build Status
- ✅ All builds passing
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ⚠️ Only ESLint warnings for unused variables

### Commits Made
1. "Fix TypeScript error: Remove incorrect globalState.state nesting"
2. "Add Tasks approval workflow, connect tenant list to GlobalState"
3. "Fix user modal profile selection for new users"
4. "Connect ticket management to GlobalState, fix view and assign functions"

## Recommended Next Steps

### High Priority (Should be done immediately)
1. **Policy visibility on tenant site** - Critical for tenant admins
2. **Visitor invitation operations** - Core functionality
3. **Parking management fixes** - Core functionality

### Medium Priority (Should be done soon)
1. **Module/profile edit/delete** - Admin functionality
2. **Digital badge user selection** - Better UX
3. **Modules menu inheritance** - Proper profile system

### Low Priority (Nice to have)
1. **Digital badge on user creation** - Convenience feature
2. **Template persistence** - Configuration
3. **Add Tasks menu to tenant site** - Mirror admin functionality

## Notes for Continued Development

### Pattern to Follow
When connecting features to GlobalState:
1. Import `useGlobalState` hook
2. Access data directly (e.g., `globalState.tickets`)
3. Use provided methods (e.g., `globalState.addTicket()`)
4. No need for local state for persisted data

### Common Issues Fixed
- Profile selection requires initializing editingUser with empty object
- Use IIFE `(() => { ... })()` when needing to run code in JSX
- Always match GlobalState types (lowercase for enums like 'open', 'high', etc.)
- Format displayed text with proper casing (e.g., capitalize first letter)

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create new tenant → appears on home page
- [ ] Create new user with profile → modules shown
- [ ] Upload white label logo → saves to GlobalState
- [ ] View ticket → shows full details
- [ ] Assign ticket to user → updates status
- [ ] Create task → appears in Tasks menu
- [ ] Approve/reject task → updates status
