# Building Management Feature - Implementation Progress

## Overview
Building Management is a new feature that allows admins to define the physical structure of tenant buildings, including basement levels, floors, and zones within each floor. This configuration serves as the foundation for parking, locker, and space management.

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. GlobalStateContext Updates
- âœ… Added `BuildingFloor` interface with `floorNumber`, `floorLabel`, and `zones[]`
- âœ… Added `Building` interface with full structure
- âœ… Added `buildings` array to GlobalState
- âœ… Added `addBuilding`, `updateBuilding`, and `deleteBuilding` functions
- âœ… Integrated building functions into context provider value
- âœ… Added audit logging for all building operations

### 2. Sample Data
- âœ… Created 3 sample buildings:
  - **Building A** (ACME tenant): 21-floor tower with 2 basement levels
  - **Building B** (M Bank tenant): 10-floor mid-rise with 1 basement level  
  - **Building C** (E Asset Manager tenant): 5-floor low-rise with 4 basement garage levels
- âœ… Each building has comprehensive floor and zone configurations

## ðŸš§ Remaining Tasks

### 3. Admin Page - Navigation (NEXT)
- Add "Building Management" menu item (only visible when tenant is selected)
- Position after "Space Management"

### 4. Admin Page - Building Management Section
- Display list of buildings for selected tenant
- Show building cards with floor visualization
- Add/Edit/Delete building functionality
- Visual floor diagram showing zones per floor

### 5. Admin Page - Building Modal
- Dynamic floor range selection (basement to top floor)
- Zone editor for each floor
- Form validation

### 6. Integration with Existing Management Sections
Need to replace free-text inputs with dropdowns that pull from building configuration:
- **Parking Management**: Building, Floor (level), Zone selection
- **Locker Management**: Building, Floor, Zone selection
- **Space Management**: Building, Floor, Zone selection

### 7. Tenant Page - Read-only Building View
- Display building configuration
- No edit capabilities
- Visual representation of floors and zones

### 8. Testing
- Build and verify no TypeScript errors
- Test full CRUD for buildings
- Test dropdown integration in parking/locker/space management

## Building Data Structure

```typescript
interface BuildingFloor {
  floorNumber: number      // -4 to 21 (negative = basement)
  floorLabel: string       // "B4", "Ground", "1", "21"
  zones: string[]          // ["East Wing", "West Wing"]
}

interface Building {
  id: string
  name: string
  tenantId: string
  basementLevels: number   // 4 means floors -4 to -1
  topFloor: number         // 21 means floors 1 to 21
  floors: BuildingFloor[]
  createdAt: string
  updatedAt: string
}
```

## Next Steps
1. Add Building Management to admin navigation
2. Create the Building Management UI section
3. Implement the building modal with floor/zone editor
4. Update parking/locker/space modals to use building config dropdowns
5. Add read-only building view to tenant page
6. Build and test

## Notes
- Ground floor is represented as floor number 0
- Basement floors are negative numbers (-1, -2, -3, -4)
- Above-ground floors are positive numbers (1, 2, 3...21)
- Floor labels can be customized (e.g., "Basement", "B1", "Ground", "Lobby")
